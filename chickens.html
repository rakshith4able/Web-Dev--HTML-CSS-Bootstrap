Chicken
<p>
    The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl,
    originally
    from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be called a cockerel.
    A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is
    called a pullet.

    Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies,
    chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[1][2]
    Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
